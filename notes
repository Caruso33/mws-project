Requirements
Make the provided site fully responsive.
All of the page elements should be usable and visible in any viewport,
including desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. Images shouldn't overlap,
and page elements should wrap when the viewport is too small to display
them side by side.

Make the site accessible.
Using what you've learned about web accessibility,
ensure that alt attributes are present and descriptive for images.
Add screen-reader-only attributes when appropriate to add
useful supplementary text. Use semantic markup where possible,
and aria attributes when semantic markup is not feasible.

Cache the static site for offline use. Using Cache API and a ServiceWorker,
cache the data for the website so that any page (including images) that
has been visited is accessible offline.

Convert the provided site to use a responsive design .
Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used;
all responsiveness should be done with CSS.
Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags
Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS
Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes
Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of
any mobile device
Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is
generated by JavaScript functions).
Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets
so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when

the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker
features.
